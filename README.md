# Python Project Template

A robust, well-organized Python project template designed to serve as a solid foundation for interactive applications using Pygame. This template emphasizes modularity, clear state management, robust error handling, and comprehensive logging.

## Features

- **Modular Structure:**  
  Organized file structure with dedicated folders for assets, settings, and core logic.
  
- **State Management:**  
  A flexible state system with a base `State` class, a sample `MenuState`, and a `StateManager` to control transitions.

- **Event Handling & Rendering:**  
  Uses Pygame to manage events, update states, and render graphics.

- **Robust Logging:**  
  Detailed logging setup (logs written to `program.log`) for easy debugging and monitoring.

- **Configuration & Validation:**  
  Settings are loaded from JSON files with helper functions ensuring configuration and control keys are valid.

- **Graceful Shutdown:**  
  Signal handling for SIGTERM and KeyboardInterrupt to ensure the application shuts down cleanly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pygame:** Install via pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo

### Customization
- **Settings:**
Modify src/Settings/program.json to configure options such as fullscreen mode, screen size, FPS, and controls.

- **State Management:**
Extend the state system by creating new state classes in src/states.py and updating the StateManager accordingly.

- **Asset Organization:**
Place images, sounds, models, and scripts in the corresponding subdirectories within src/Assets/.

### Code Overview
- **main.py:**
The entry point of the program. It sets up logging, handles signals, and starts the main program loop.

- **program.py:**
Contains the Program class, which initializes Pygame, manages the main loop, and coordinates state transitions.

- **states.py:**
Implements a base State class for handling events, updating objects, and rendering, along with a sample MenuState and a StateManager.

- **functions.py:**
Offers helper functions for tasks like loading settings, retrieving the display size, and mapping control keys.

- **checks.py:**
Provides utility functions for validating object attributes, checking JSON validity, and ensuring file paths exist.

- **Logging:**
Logs are configured in main.py and written to program.log. These logs capture events, errors, and debug messages to help you trace the application’s behavior.
