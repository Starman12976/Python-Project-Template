# Python Project Template

A robust, well-organized Python project template designed to serve as a solid foundation for interactive applications using Pygame. This template emphasizes modularity, clear state management, robust error handling, and comprehensive logging.

## Features

- **Modular Structure:**  
  Organized file structure with dedicated folders for assets, settings, and core logic.
  
- **State Management:**  
  A flexible state system with a base `State` class, a sample `MenuState`, and a `StateManager` to control transitions.

- **Event Handling & Rendering:**  
  Uses Pygame to manage events, update states, and render graphics.

- **Robust Logging:**  
  Detailed logging setup (logs written to `program.log`) for easy debugging and monitoring.

- **Configuration & Validation:**  
  Settings are loaded from JSON files with helper functions ensuring configuration and control keys are valid.

- **Graceful Shutdown:**  
  Signal handling for SIGTERM and KeyboardInterrupt to ensure the application shuts down cleanly.

Copy
python src/main.py
Customization
Settings:
Modify src/Settings/program.json to configure options such as fullscreen mode, screen size, FPS, and controls.

State Management:
Extend the state system by creating new state classes in src/states.py and updating the StateManager accordingly.

Asset Organization:
Place images, sounds, models, and scripts in the corresponding subdirectories within src/Assets/.

Code Overview
main.py:
The entry point of the program. It sets up logging, handles signals, and starts the main program loop.

program.py:
Contains the Program class, which initializes Pygame, manages the main loop, and coordinates state transitions.

states.py:
Implements a base State class for handling events, updating objects, and rendering, along with a sample MenuState and a StateManager.

functions.py:
Offers helper functions for tasks like loading settings, retrieving the display size, and mapping control keys.

checks.py:
Provides utility functions for validating object attributes, checking JSON validity, and ensuring file paths exist.

Logging
Logs are configured in main.py and written to program.log. These logs capture events, errors, and debug messages to help you trace the application’s behavior.
